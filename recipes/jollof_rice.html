    <p>Jollof rice is a dish with deep roots in West African culture, and its one that carries with it a
        sense of community, celebration, and tradition. In my household, this recipe has always been a
        staple, passed down from my Nigerian mum who has absolutely perfected it.</p>
    <p>Each pot of this Nigerian jollof rice brings with it the memories of family gatherings and
        festive occasions, but its also a comfort food we enjoy on any day of the week.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For the base:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large red bell pepper, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>2 medium vine tomatoes, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 red onion, quartered</li>
            <li>2 red scotch bonnet chillies, quartered</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
            <li>25g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>100ml water</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the rice:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>150ml vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 red onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>150g double concentrated tomato purée (we use DeRica)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>3 chicken stock cubes</li>
            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>600ml water</li>
            <li>600g white basmati rice</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the base ingredients in a blender and blitz until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven set over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes, then add the tomato purée and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to darken, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the blended base, stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and partially cover the pot with the lid - it will splatter! Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced by about a third of its original volume and the oil begins to separate from the sauce, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the curry powder, thyme, stock cubes, bay leaves and water. Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste, then cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rinse the rice thoroughly with cold water until the water runs clean, then drain. Add the rice to the sauce and stir to combine. As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and cook for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>By this point, the rice should have absorbed all the liquid and be cooked through. Remove the bay leaves, give the rice a stir and you're ready to serve, preferably with grilled chicken and fried plantain.</li>
    </ol>

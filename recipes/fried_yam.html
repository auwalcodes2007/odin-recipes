    <img src="fried_yam.jpeg" alt="Image of Fried Yam and egg sauce">
    <p>Egg sauce and fried yam is one of the breakfast staples in Nigeria or should I say weekend breakfast.</p>
    <p>Fried yam and egg sauce is very easy to make. Typically in Nigeria, we use tomatoes, scotch bonnet chilli and
        onions in making this sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tuber of yam</li>
        <li>4-6 eggs</li>
        <li>2 medium-sized tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1-2 scotch bonnet, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt plus 1 tsp for yam</li>
        <li>1 Seasoning cube</li>
        <li>½ tsp curry</li>
        <li>½ tsp thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For the yam</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the desired amount and rinse with water.</li>
            <li>Put some oil on the fire to heat up a bit.</li>
            <li>Slice yam into desired shapes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the water and add a bit of salt.</li>
            <li>Put the yam in the oil and allow to fry for some time till desired crispness.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>For the egg sauce</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Set your frying pan on the heat and add just 200ml of oil (vegetable or olive oil), allow one minute
                before adding the sliced tomatoes/onions/peppers. It is best if you have a non-stick frying pan.</li>
            <li>Allow this to fry for 10-15 minutes. Remember to always stir, you don't want to end up with burnt
                tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Once it is fried, should take 15 minutes of frying and stirring.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste. Add half a seasoning cube.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs in a separate plate. Add a pinch of salt to it and then pour on top of the frying
                tomato/onion/pepper combination. Allow a minute and then stir. Try to break the crumbs into smaller
                sizes.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
